# Aeon Flux

This is an aborted attempt to start writing a Vim-inspired IDE for [Flux](https://github.com/Rene-Damm/flux-ml) (at some point). ATM it's pretty much just some text editor parts and the beginnings of a command execution system. Was fun to dig into algorithms for text editors and implement a [gap buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer).

It's written in [PureBasic](https://www.purebasic.com).
